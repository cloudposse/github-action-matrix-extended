# Short description of this project
description: GitHub Action to group list of Atmos stacks and split each group on chunks of 256 items.

introduction: |-
  GitHub Actions matrix have [limit to 256 items](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs#using-a-matrix-strategy)
  There is workaround to extend the limit with [reusable workflows](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/38704)
  This GitHub Action expect to have 2 nesting workflows levels.
  In theory run 256 ^ 2 (i.e., 65536) jobs per workflow run!
  
  !!!!!Important!!!!!
  Restrict concurrency to avoid DDOS GitHub Actions API and get restriction on your account.
  
  | Matrix nested level | Concurrency |
  |---------------------|-------------|
  |         1           |       1     |
  |         2           |       x     |

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ### Matrix Level 1 - Iterate over account
  
  ```yaml
    name: Pull Request
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ 'main' ]
        types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

    jobs:
      atmos-affected:
        runs-on: self-hosted
        name: Affected stacks
        outputs:
          matrix: ${{ steps.components.outputs.output }}
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            with:
              ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
    
          - id: affected
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-stacks@v1
    
          - id: matrix
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-matrix-unlimited@main
            with:              
              input: ${{ toJson(fromJson(steps.affected.outputs.matrix).include) }}
              sort-by: .stack_slug
              group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")
  
      atmos-plan:
        if: ${{ needs.atmos-affected.outputs.accounts != '{"include":[]}' }}
        uses: ./.github/workflows/atmos-terraform-plan-account.yaml
        needs:
          - atmos-affected
        strategy:
          max-parallel: 1 # This is important to avoid ddos GHA API
          fail-fast: false # Don't fail fast to avoid locking TF State
          matrix: ${{ fromJson(needs.atmos-affected.outputs.matrix) }}
        name: Plan (${{ matrix.name }})
        with:
          stacks: ${{ matrix.items }}
  ```
  
  ### Matrix Level 2 - Do real work
  
  ```yaml
    # ./.github/workflows/atmos-terraform-plan-account.yaml
    on:
      workflow_call:
        inputs:
          stacks:
            description: "Stacks"
            required: true
            type: string

    jobs:
      atmos-plan:
        if: ${{ inputs.stacks != '{include:[]}' }}
        strategy:
          max-parallel: 10
          fail-fast: false # Don't fail fast to avoid locking TF State
          matrix: ${{ fromJson(inputs.stacks) }}
        ## Avoid running the same stack in parallel mode (from different workflows)
        concurrency:
          group: ${{ matrix.stack_slug }}
          cancel-in-progress: false
        name: ${{ matrix.stack_slug }}
        steps:
          - name: Plan Atmos Component
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v0
            with:
              component: ${{ matrix.component }}
              stack: ${{ matrix.stack }}
              component-path: ${{ matrix.component_path }}
